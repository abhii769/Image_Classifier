# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with TensorFlow

A deep learning project utilizing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) built with TensorFlow to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into 10 distinct categories. The model's architecture was optimized for improved accuracy by incorporating advanced features like max-pooling and fully connected layers.

## Features

- **Image Classification**: Predicts categories such as airplanes, cars, birds, cats, and more from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
- **Optimized CNN Architecture**: Includes max-pooling layers for dimensionality reduction and fully connected layers for classification.  
- **High Accuracy**: Enhanced performance through architectural optimizations and fine-tuning.

## Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Framework**: TensorFlow  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Dataset**: CIFAR-10  

## Dataset Details

- CIFAR-10 is a labeled dataset consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class.  
- Classes include: Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, and Truck.
